  "description": "# AWSSupport-TroubleshootCfnCustomResource\n\n----\n\nThe *AWSSupport-TroubleshootCfnCustomResource* runbook is designed to help troubleshooting Cloudformation stack which failed to [create, update ] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html) or [delete](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudformation-lambda-resource-delete/) a custom resource. This automation runbook checks the service token used for the custom resource along with the error message returned.\nFor lambda baked custom resources, the runbook checks if the lambda is able to reach S3 endpoint to send a response back to cloudformation such as checking lambda network configuration VPC and security groups.\n\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\n* This runbook doesn't make any changes to your cloudformation stack.\n* This runbook doesn't check your lambda function logic, or your service provider and application logs.\n\n### Workflow Specifications:\n\n This workflow uses AWS Systems Manager Automation and takes in the following parameters:\n\n- **StackName** - **(Required)**: The cloudformation stack name. \n- **AutomationAssumeRole** - **(Optional)** The IAM role which AWS Systems Manager will assume to execute this automation. This role must allow these IAM actions:\n\n        - cloudformation:DescribeStacks\n        - cloudformation:DescribeStackEvents\n        - cloudformation:ListStackResources\n        - ec2:DescribeRouteTables\n        - ec2:DescribeNatGateways\n        - ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups\n        - ec2:DescribeVpcs\n        - ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints\n        - ec2:DescribeSubnets\n        - logs:FilterLogEvents\n\n\n\nPlease visit the documentation on [Automation Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-setup.html) for more information.",
