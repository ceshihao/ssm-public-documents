  "description": "The **AWSSupport-TroubleshootCloudWatchAgent** runbook automates troubleshooting the Amazon CloudWatch Agent on your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. The runbook performs this troubleshooting through a series of basic, and (optional) extended checks.\n\nThe basic checks include the following:\n\n\t1. Check for an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile\n\t2. Verify if the necessary Amazon CloudWatch Agent AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions are attached to the Amazon EC2 instance\n\nThe extended checks are only performed if the Amazon EC2 instance ID provided is an AWS Systems Manager managed instance. These extended checks include the following:\n\n\t1. Check the status of the Amazon CloudWatch Agent on the instance\n\t2. Analyze the logs of the Amazon CloudWatch Agent for common issues and relevant troubleshooting steps\n\t3. Zip the relevant logs and configuration files on the Amazon EC2 instance and optionally upload them to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket of your choosing\n\t4. Perform a connectivity check between the instance and the required endpoints\n\nWhen the 'RunVpcReachabilityAnalyzer' parameter is set to 'true', this runbook will determine if there is a need to call the child runbook, **AWSSupport-AnalyzeAWSEndpointReachabilityFromEC2**. It does this if one of two criteria are satisfied:\n\n\t1. The instance is not an AWS Systems Manager managed instance\n\t2. The instance is an AWS Systems Manager manged instance, and one of the connectivity checks between the instance and the required endpoints resulted in a 'failed' message output.\nIf either of these situations occur, this child runbook can help diagnose DNS configuration issues, VPC endpoint issues, or reachability between the instance and the IGW/NAT.\n\n### Workflow Specifications\nFor information on the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions and input parameters required to run this Automation, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshoot-cloudwatch-agent.html).\n\n### Important\nThe child runbook, **AWSSupport-AnalyzeAWSEndpointReachabilityFromEC2** does not directly perform any connectivity checks to the required endpoints. Instead, it uses 'VPC Reachability Analyzer' which has an associated cost. For more information on pricing, refer to the documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/).\nIf you have a complex Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) routing setup that includes peering connections or resources such as transit gateways, this may not provide an accurate assessment of the reachability to the AWS endpoints. For more information on this child runbook, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-analyzeawsendpointreachabilityfromec2.html).\n\nThis runbook only checks your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile role for the necessary permissions. If you instead rely on credentials defined in a [.aws/credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-common-scenarios.html#CloudWatch-Agent-run-as-user), the results of the 'verifyIamPermissions' step may be inaccurate.",
