  "description": "### Document name - AWSFIS-Run-Kill-Process\n\n## What does this document do?\nIt kills a particular process by name in an instance, using the `killall` command.\nThis SSM document supports Amazon Linux and Ubuntu operating systems only.\n\n## Dependencies installed by this SSM Document\n* killall\nNote: This SSM document does not uninstall dependencies once installed. If you don't want this SSM document to install any dependencies, set InstallDependencies to False and bake the dependencies into your EC2 instance. For example, by using image-builder (https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/).\n\n## Input Parameters\n* ProcessName: (Required) Name of the process to kill.\n* Signal: The SIGNAL to be sent along with the kill command (default: SIGTERM). The allowed values are:\n  * SIGTERM: Signal used for gracefully terminate a process. Can be referred as soft kill, because the receiver may choose to ignore it.\n  * SIGKILL: Signal used for immediate termination of a process. Cannot be caught, ignored or blocked. Child processes are killed as well.\n\n## Output Parameters\nNone.",
