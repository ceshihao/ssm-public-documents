If you don't want this SSM document to install any dependencies, set InstallDependencies to False and bake the dependencies into your EC2 instance. For example, by using image-builder (https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder/).\n\n## Input Parameters\n* ProcessName: (Required) Name of the process to kill.\n* Signal: The SIGNAL to be sent along with the kill command (default: SIGTERM). The allowed values are:\n  * SIGTERM: Signal used for gracefully terminate a process. Can be referred as soft kill, because the receiver may choose to ignore it.\n  * SIGKILL: Signal used for immediate termination of a process. Cannot be caught, ignored or blocked. Child processes are killed as well.\n\n## Output Parameters\nNone.",
