  "description": "Tutorial: Configuring SSL/TLS with Amazon Linux\n===\n\nThis procedure takes you through the process of setting up TLS on Amazon Linux with a self-signed digital\ncertificate.\n\nNote:  A self-signed certificate is acceptable for testing but not production. If you expose your self-signed\ncertificate to the internet, visitors to your site are greeted by security warnings.\n\nPre-requisites\n---\n\nTo run the following Automation document, you must have permissions to\n* Run automation workflows,\n* Call the EC2 ```DescribeSecurityGroups``` and ```AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress``` API actions\n\nThe Automation workflow runs in the context of the current AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user. \n\nAdditionally, you must run the Automation document [```AWS-InstallALAMPServer-AL```](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/documents/AWS-InstallALAMPServer-AL/description)\nbefore using this document. If the stack `LAMPStack-AL2` has not been created, it will be automatically created.\n\nOutputs\n---\n\nOnce the Automation has completed, you will be able to use HTTPS to connect to your web server by navigating to the public DNS address (or the public IP address) of the launched instance. For example:\n\n>https://my.public.dns.amazonaws.com/\n\nCleanup\n---\n\nTo remove resources created by this Automation document. Navigate to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) and delete the stack created by the preceding Automation document. \n\n*Provide feedback [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?feedback_destination_id=fdb9de10-9bb3-4e90-b330-df8c2533c9dd&topic_url=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutomatedTutorials/AWSDocs-Configure-SSL-TLS-AL).*",
