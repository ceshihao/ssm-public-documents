  "description": "The **AWSSupport-TroubleshootPatchManagerLinux** runbook helps in evaluating and diagnosing failed executions of the **AWS-RunPatchBaseline** AWS Systems Manager document against Linux based AWS Systems Manager managed instances. AWS-RunPatchBaseline is the default AWS Systems Manager document used by the Patch Manager. The runbook analyzes the patching logs present on the instance to try to find the cause of the failure and provide recommended remediation steps for the errors found.\n\n### Supported operating systems:\n - Amazon Linux 2, and 2023\n - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.X, and 9.X\n - Centos 8.X, and 9.X\n - Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04\n - SUSE 15.X\n### Prerequisites:\n\n- The instance must be Linux-based and managed by AWS Systems Manager.\n- The following packages must be available on the instance: **Python 3.7 or later, wget or curl, and unzip. **Note:** We recommend upgrading to Python 3.8 or later to minimize impact of future update operations. Refer to this [public documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) for more information. \n- The instance can connect to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) service endpoints to download the code from AWS owned bucket `arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-document-attachments-region/`.\n\n**Note**: The input parameter **RunCommandId** is optional. If you do not provide a specific Command ID to evaluate, the automation looks for last unsuccessful execution of `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` for the instance. If you provide a Command ID as the input, the Command ID must have been executed in last **30 days**. This is because the Run Command history retention period is 30 days.",

The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role initiating the command doesn't have access to the targeted managed node.
