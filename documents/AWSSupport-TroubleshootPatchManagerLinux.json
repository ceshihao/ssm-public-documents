  "description": "The **AWSSupport-TroubleshootPatchManagerLinux** runbook helps in evaluating and diagnosing failed executions of the **AWS-RunPatchBaseline** AWS Systems Manager document against Linux based AWS Systems Manager managed instances. AWS-RunPatchBaseline is the default AWS Systems Manager document used by the Patch Manager. The runbook analyzes the patching logs present on the instance to try to find the cause of the failure and provide recommended remediation steps for the errors found.\n\n### Supported operating systems:\n - Amazon Linux 2, and 2023\n - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.X 9.X and 10.X\n - Centos 8.X, and 9.X\n - Ubuntu 18.04-24.04\n - SUSE 15.X\n### Prerequisites:\n\n- The instance must be Linux-based and managed by AWS Systems Manager.\n- The following packages must be available on the instance: **Python 3.7 or later, wget or curl, and unzip**. **Note:** We recommend upgrading to Python 3.11 or later to minimize impact of future update operations. Refer to this [public documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/python-support-policy-updates-for-aws-sdks-and-tools/) for more information. \n- The instance can connect to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) service endpoints to download the code from AWS owned bucket `arn:aws:s3:::aws-ssm-document-attachments-region/`.\n\n**Note**: The input parameter **RunCommandId** is optional. If you do not provide a specific Command ID to evaluate, the automation looks for last unsuccessful execution of `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` for the instance. If you provide a Command ID as the input, the Command ID must have been executed in last **30 days**. This is because the Run Command history retention period is 30 days.",

The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role initiating the command doesn't have access to the targeted managed node. Ensure the user or role have necessary permissions to use the Run Command feature. For more details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security-iam.html\"\n\nExecutionTimedOut_info = f\"{INFO_ICON} The Command failed with Execution Timed Out.

The command wasn't delivered to the managed node before the total timeout expired. \\n\\nPossible reason would be the Instance is not available or the SSM agent running on the instance is not able to receive the Command. The later can be due to SSM agent not working properly or network issues. Check the SSM agent Logs and confirm SSM agent was running at the time of Command Invocation.

The command couldn't be delivered to the managed node. The node might not exist or it might not be responding. \\n\\nPossible reason would be the Instance is not available, stopped or terminated. This can also happen if the Instance was in Connection Lost when command was attempted to send to the Instance. \\n Other possibles reasons are SSM agent is not working properly or network issues on the instance. Check the SSM agent Logs at /var/log/amazon/ssm and confirm SSM agent was running at the time of Command Invocation.
